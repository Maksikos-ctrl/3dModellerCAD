```
pip install pyopengl
```




## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:

```
python viewer.py
```

This will open a window displaying the 3D scene. You can interact with the scene using the following mouse actions:

    Pick: left-click on an object to select it
    Move: left-click and drag an object to move it
    Scale: right-click and drag an object to scale it
